# Project

The project involves building a data analytics system for "Rápidos y Furiosos," a courier company operating in various cities across Colombia. The company's goal is to support its decision-making processes by analyzing the data generated by its customers and couriers. "Rápidos y Furiosos" already has an operational information system that manages clients and services, but due to growth and increased demand, new challenges have emerged, such as customer complaints about delivery delays and couriers reporting issues with certain clients.

## Business processes

### Courier services management

- Service request: customers request courier services through a web application, specifying the city of origin and destination, addresses and delivery times (express, within 2-3 hours, or during the day).

- Service assignment: when a new service is registered, a notification is sent to available couriers. A courier picks up the service through a mobile application, which changes the service status to "With assigned courier".

- Service delivery: the courier picks up the order at the origin address and delivers it to the destination address. The service goes through several statuses (Initiated, With assigned courier, Picked up at origin, Delivered at destination, Closed).

- Shipment status monitoring: customers can check the status of the service through the operational application at any time.

### News management

- News management: if unforeseen events occur, such as mechanical failures or customer delays, the courier can report news, which can alter the delivery time.
